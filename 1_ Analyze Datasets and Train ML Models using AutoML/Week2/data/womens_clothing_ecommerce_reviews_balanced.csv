-1,I was intrigued by the pattern of this blouse (the purple version) but the design is terrible for me. it's boxy  i didn't like the fabric  and the arm ruffles are bizarre. it's going back tomorrow.,Blouses
-1,"I bought two  one in white and one in blue print and wore the blue print top once and loved it. then i washed it according to the instructions on the tag (in cold gentle cycle and hung to dry). it shrunk up 4"" in the length and 2"" in the width and now it doesn't fit at all. also  after one wear  the buttons are coming off (before i even put it in the wash) and it's covered in loose threads. the quality is just not there. i'm going to return both and show the sales lady the difference in size on",Blouses
-1,Absolutely beautiful top  worn once...hand washed and that's all she wrote..ruined!! the black trim bled all over the top!! i tried everything you could imagine to get this back to normal! do not recommend!! :(,Blouses
-1,I thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on  it is so big on the bottom  it looks like a tent. i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big. sad.,Blouses
-1,Note to photographers: please don't cinch the wait of a blouse to make something look tailored when it isn't. this could have been a real win if it had been more simply executed. i'm petite  way too much fabric. returned.,Blouses
-1,Loved loved loved the shirt but...the material was so thin,Blouses
-1,This looked like a simple  chic blouse  but the fabric felt cheap to me  like thin lining fabric. the neckline is too deep and wide as well and so not flattering.,Blouses
-1,I ordered this shirt online and didn't even try it on... it is super see through and i would need to wear a tank underneath and i don't want to have that extra layer in the summer.  it is cute though!,Blouses
-1,Why do designers keep making crop tops??!! i can't imagine this would be flattering on anyone  especially someone average height and well endowed on top. i looked like a football player. the pattern and fabric are gorgeous  so if you are like 4' tall and super tiny and can fit xxs this may work? i am between a 6-8 and fit a small and it was huge on me and almost was bigger at the bottom than the top. such a weird cut. there is a cami underneath so if it rides up that will show but that is so 80s,Blouses
0,I'd recommend getting this top- but only after understanding its limitations. it's beautiful and i bought it even after reading the other critical and accurate reviews because i so loved how it paired with the skirt. unless you size down the rigid form of the embellished straps will lie funny  and the rest of the top fits bizarrely as it is both short (it could almost expose the bottom of your stomach) and has lots of fabric so it almost flows out all around you (accentuating your stomach and ma,Blouses
0,I wish this fit more to the body  it really does flare out a lot a adding volume to the person wearing it. the mustard color is beautiful  so is the pink (i ordered both to compare). but the 00 was still big on me (and p). so i passed.  fabric is light for summer  so if you are thin  not muscular  perhaps that would look great?,Blouses
0,Purchased this top because of the sale. i got it in the peach and the maize. i think it is big  boxy  and loose but at the sale price it is not a bad top to have. the colors are vibrant and striking. pretty with shorts and capris. i did size down from 2 to 0,Blouses
0,I saw this top in the box and was excited to try it on. the print is absolutely stunning and gorgeous  i could not wait. when i tried it on  it is such a loose top and a tad short. it was flowy all over. i expected it to be loose from the picture but not like this. it would work best on a very slender figure with white pants or leggings. i don't recommend it for a curvy figure  just not flattering. makes everything look big. what a waste because the print is so nice.,Blouses
0,"I was initially drawn to the intricate floral design of the neutral motif. it looks huge and boxy  so i sized down to a 0- which ended up being too tight in the chest and arm holes (for reference  i'm 5'7""  130lbs  34a). i returned it for a size 2  which fit much better. in the end  i decided not to keep it because of the lack of shape  and it's a little unflattering for smaller busts. it does come with a matching cami and seems well-made  but it just wasn't for me.",Blouses
0,"I'm still on the fence with this shirt. i have the grey - it almost looks like a cheetah design up close. i'm 5'3""",Blouses
0,"I so wanted this blouse to work. the lacework is beautiful  and it is a substantial and well made top. the neck fits well  which is not a given for this style top  and i really like the 3/4 length sleeves. but the top billows out like a tent on me in all directions  and it was an awkward length on me (not quite hip length  not quite tunic). wish this were cut a little straighter and longer. i'm 5'4""  120 lbs and tried a size s.",Blouses
0,I ordered this item when it was first advertised  fell in love with the unique pattern in the top and could hardly wait for it to get here. however when i received the top i was very disappointed  the fabric is cheap  the sleeves are tight and the overall product is of poor quality and poorly constructed. needless to say i returned it.,Blouses
0,I'm so disappointed with the fit of this top. it is extremely short  even for my 5'2 frame. sizing up will not fix the length. too bad  because the shirt is cute.,Blouses
1,This blouse in the purple motif is lovely. unfortunately for me  it runs small.,Blouses
1,I love this blouse! i just bought it recently and have yet to wear it out other than trying it on. this blouse looked very nice on me which can be challenging. i don't live near an retailer so i have to order online exclusively. i have larger hips (135lbs  5'6) and finding flattering tops can be tough. sometimes they look amazing online and then once i try them on  they just don't look right. some shirts have a tendency to accentuate my hips too much making me look shorter. this top looked great a,Blouses
1,This top is so beautiful and well made  and the detailing in the back is gorgeous. it's unexpected and makes this piece really special. it does run a tiny bit large; i've gotten retailer chambray a before  and they usually shrink a touch in the wash and then for just right. i haven't washed this yet  but even a little large it fits well and hangs nicely without being overly baggy. get this  you won't regret it!,Blouses
1,The only negative thing i have to say is that the color in person is different than the picture- it is much more of a coral pink than a rosy pink  which is fine just a tad unexpected! i ordered a size 8 and it fits perfectly (32ddd chest). the laser cut outs in the yoke add a very nice feminine  unique touch to an otherwise basic top. i can't wait to wear it!,Blouses
1,I get compliments on this top every single time i wear it. the pattern is so pretty  and while it's very lightweight  it still drapes nicely. i would caution that someone with a larger chest may find that the shape is not quite right - i am a 34d and just on the cusp of having it be too balloon-y on top.,Blouses
1,I was looking for something to wear on jeans fridays. this tunic is super cute and looks great with jeggings. i did find the sizing small for me  but i am busty.,Blouses
1,I was pleasantly surprised to find this piece in stock at my local store. it's a very comfortable top with plenty of room. the only criticism i have regarding it is that it's a bit maternity-esque. bought it in an xs.,Blouses
1,"Love this blouse--looks like a fp blouse yet a bit cheaper and well made! looks feminine and edgy on. may size out for taller gals b/c it is a bit on the shorter length. i am 5'5"" and the length is just right on me untucked. the lace on the sleeves are gorgeous and neckline is not too high!",Blouses
1,Bypassed this blouse online  but it's striking colors caught my eye at the store. bought the olive green color and it's gorgeous! the color is great for both spring and fall. i'm normally a petite xs at 5'0 feet and 104 pounds  the regular xs is a great fit for me. not too boxy and the length hits right at my waist. material is lighweight and flowey. don't hesitate to buy  it's a great piece to add some pop of color and goes great with skinny jeans..,Blouses
-1,I ordered this in cream during the 25% sale. i had seen one at the store and thought it was very pretty  but it was not my size  so i didn't try it on. when it arrived  it was a wrinkled mess. it was so wrinkled that i don't think i would be able to iron it satisfactorily. i was also disappointed in the fabric of the dress layer. it almost looked flocked and i wonder if something is wrong with this dress in particular. it was also way too short for me. i'll be taking it back very soon. i do plan,Dresses
-1,Beautiful dress  but has an unflattering fit. i purchased an xs and it's past my knees and the bottom of the dress is so heavy! would be a perfect maternity dress though!,Dresses
-1,But  it just doesn't measure up. first  the slip/lining comes unattached if pulled slightly and it is very difficult to actually get it on - either stepping into it or pulling it over your head. and  once on  the top was a big snug and there was too much material at the bottom which made it look really bulky. unfortunately  i am finding this to be the case with so many of the items i buy from retailer lately. the material is really cute  but the dress isn't worth the price / effort.,Dresses
-1,Way too big and had a granny like styling. was very excited but ultimately took it back.,Dresses
-1,"This is a pretty dress  but the cut is quite boxy. i had thought that the dress would cut in a bit along the body and then ""flare out"" more around the waist down to the hem; however  the dress is baggy from the sleeves all the way down  which lends to a rather unflattering look.",Dresses
-1,The cowl and cuffs of the dress are thick and heavy sweater material  but the dress itself is extremely thin. the non-belted pictures do not show how much volume there is to the dress  which was enormous in my normal size.,Dresses
-1,I saw this dress online and loved the colors and whimsical embroidery . i thought it would be the perfect dress to wear on the weekend with cute sandals. i was excited when the dress arrived in the mail as the colors were vibrant and the material was soft and cozy. unfortunately this dress is huge. it is a rectangle with pockets. i bought the xxsp  my usual size and this dress was so big my sister was able to fit in it with me.this dress was beyond alterations. too bad it was a great idea but no,Dresses
-1,If you have any cleavage this dress will look awful. the ties drop pretty low & look trashy over cleavage. recommend otherwise - good fabric cool look,Dresses
-1,Love the print and was looking forward to this dress. the length and bust are just right in normal sizing  however the 'swing' effect is all off. there's so much fabric. its like wearing a moo moo. not at all flattering. disappointed in this one.,Dresses
0,This dress is very good quality  with beautiful beading on the bodice. it's a heavier material than i was expecting  but that was a pleasant surprise. unfortunately  when i put it on and looked in the mirror  i laughed out loud because i looked like a fancy swiss milkmaid. the shoulders are puffier than shown on the model and  combined with the overall design and length  i couldn't think of anywhere to wear it. this is an easy return for me. the dress runs very true to size and the bodice is fit,Dresses
0,I ordered size large and find this to be way too oversized  wide  long and unattractive on my frame. the print is just okay but since it doesn't wow me  i'm returning.,Dresses
0,I ordered this online and i love the style  but didn't like the print as much as i thought i would.,Dresses
0,I purchased this for a very good price and i typically love maeve... should have been a win-win. the fabric is thin and slinky in the most unfortunate way. it made finding appropriate undergarments very difficult. i had to add a slip (that helped) and figured that since i'm losing weight  it would look better when i'm down a few more pounds. that being said  i didn't find it to be figure flattering. i have a tummy and there was at least one photo from the bridal shower i wore this to  where i lo,Dresses
0,Very pretty dress and nicely made (the embroidery is quite lovely and double lining  as mentioned by the other reviewers  is awesome)  but not a good shape for me and my hourglass figure. like a lot of swing dresses  it has no structure  and it's not a good look on someone a little busty  as i am. in all honesty  i thought the sack-like shape of the dress made me look 20 lbs heavier than i am. i am a medium  size 6-8  and took the 8 based on the other reviews. i probably could have sized down to,Dresses
0,I so wanted to love this dress  but the bell sleeves were enormous! if you're standing completely still with your arms down they look cool  but if you move your arms at all it looks like you have wings. the rest of the dress was beautiful  though  and a flattering swingy shape even on an hourglass/pear shaped figure. i would recommend sizing down  as the dress runs large.,Dresses
0,"I was very excited about receiving this dress. unfortunately i was a little disappointed when i opened the package  as the color was darker than on the picture.  i live in florida where the sun is always shining and although this dress has a beautiful simple design  it isn't for me as the color is too ""winter"".",Dresses
0,"This dress has great potential. i happen to have a longer torso so the fit was off. as a previous review stated  it's short waisted and a lot a skirt which i agree  the hem is also funky. i am still deciding if i want to keep it  but if i do  i plan on altering the skirt to be narrower and hemming it a bit shorter too. for reference  i'm 5'3"" and weigh 110 and i purchased a size 0.",Dresses
0,"I am a proportionate 5'4"" 39 year old and thought this dress would look great. it's a-line and looks a lot like the kind of dresses that usually fit me nicely. i bought it in an 8p  which is my normal size. the hips were a little too big  but not bad. the top part  however  was enormous. the cut in the shoulders/neckline was way too wide  the lace sleeves were way too big  there was too much room in the bust (my c cup was inadequate)  etc. this dress would look nice on someone who is thicker/vol",Dresses

1,I bought this dress with my birthday gift and i do not regret it! it's so soft and feels like pure comfort but the details  little metal buttons down the front  the vent pleats on the side; make it feel special. i received many compliments and i would urge you to get this one if you are seeking comfort. it was pretty true to size and because i'm an average height i wore a small block heel with it.,Dresses
1,I ordered this online with out trying it on the store. it does hang a teeny bit loser than in the photo of the model but in my opinion doesn't look bad. plus  i'm not a model...;) what i did was put a thick belt on and it just brought the dress to a new level. love it with a belt. i am an art teacher and it was perfect for work and then going out after with friends.

1,"When i saw this dress i knew i had to have it! i loved the colors and design. i am a wedding planner and dresses with pockets are my ""uniform""  i was a little concerned after reading some of the other reviews  but i ordered anyway and am glad i did! it fits perfect and looks just like the photo.",Dresses
1,"Beautiful colors and silhouette (i got the navy). the skirt is lined and flows wonderfully when you walk. i've gotten a ton of compliments on it. i'm 5'9"" and the high hem falls a few inches below my knee  and the low hem falls to my ankles.",Dresses
1,The fabric is very nice and it is completely lined  except for the sleeves  which are sheer. i expected the dress to be lighter  so wearing this on a hot day won't work. i ordered an xs because of the former reviews it said it ran large and it does. it's roomy  straight  and quite flowy.  i wanted a casual non clinging dress and it's just like the picture. it hits below the knee.,Dresses

-1,Did not work for me. material was a bit thin  poor quality  the tie doesn't quite work correctly. had a cheaper look to it. not the quality i'd normally expect. this is going back.,Fine gauge
-1,I was minimally torn over whether to return this but ultimately it's going back because the knit is just too thin. i thought it would be cozy and be of normal sweater weight but it's not. and because it's so light  the swing effect doesn't really come off. nothing special.,Fine gauge
-1,After washing this top pilled terribly. it is beautiful  but only for one use.,Fine gauge
-1,I couldn't wait to try this on this sweater.  sadly  it was too large in all ways.  the sleeves are adorable  but the ruffle overwhelmed my arms. this was much longer on me than the model.  it stopped mid-thigh.  the quality seemed fine  but it is a thin sweater.,Fine gauge
-1,I loved the way it looks on. fit tts. only problem for me was it was so itchy. there is that small amt. of wool in it. if you have any problem with wool this may not work for you,Fine gauge
-1,I also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images. it is very thin as others have said. the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured. it is more similar to a cape or shawl design. if you;'re looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design  this is not it. i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design.,Fine gauge
-1,I tried on this sweater...love the flowing top  and it looked like the seam would hit right under my bustline.  wrong.  the seam came right across my bust on a medium; sized up to a large  same thing. this shouldn't happen! not sure who this would actually flatter.  the sweater is high quality  and the colors are perfect. the fit needs work.,Fine gauge

0,So when i saw a sweater with a big llama face on the front of it  i knew it must be mine. i ordered it and eagerly awaited its arrival. while the llama print and color of the sweater are ah-mazing  the fit of the sweater leaves something to be desired. i'm a 36 dd and mostly a size l  so that's what i ordered. it wasn't snug  but it didn't have the cut to pull off the oversized drapey look  so the areas where it was loose looked...strange. the sleeves were really long too  but i could have rolle,Fine gauge

0,"Tried this on in the ""onsie"" area of retailer store. i usually am between a medium and a large. the medium fit fine. the material in this top is substantial - very thick and soft but it is very thick as a warning. more for a pretty cool spring evening vs the heat of the summer in chicago. not sure how much the material would stretch out either. as it seems like it could be the type. also  it is dry clean only  and on such a casual top  that is a real deal killer for me.     regarding the style of",Fine gauge
0,This is a beautiful sweater that i wanted to love but i couldn't for a few reasons i thought i'd share: the color is bright orange. it is not softer like peach in the picture. it also was more clingy than a curvy woman like me can wear. i thought'd be more swingy but it was more structured. very pretty and good quality tho.,Fine gauge
0,This thing sheds so much it's almost unuseable but i used an entire roll of sticky roller and got it to the point where i could wear it with only a glob of fuzz on my underwear not other people's couches. it's cute and fits well other than that. buy a sticky roller!,Fine gauge
0,I really like the idea behind this top  but at least for me  the execution wasn't quite there. i was hoping it would be something i could wear to work  but the sheerness of the sides makes it in appropriate for my workplace (when it gaps/you move  you can see a lot). if you don't move  the front panel is pretty opaque  which is good. i think it would look odd with a cami underneath and i don't feel comfortable with the sheerness  so i returned it. i also thought the finish on the sleeves looked,Fine gauge
0,The quality of the fabric is soft and thick and well made. loved everything about it but if you are ample in the chest  it is snug and does not hang and drape as well like on the model  so you may want to size up. i am sending it back as the fit is not flattering on me for the price. someone with a boyish no-curve figure would look dynamite in it!,Fine gauge
0,I want to like this sweater. the color is lovely  more of a grayish blue  and the design is nice. the quality is amazingly good  as it's thick without being too thick and very soft. but the design is odd and quite unflattering! i got the xsmall but it's two big. the sleeves have a very low shoulder so they almost have a wing like look. it doesn't look like it does on this model. the waist area is a lot bigger  so it does sit on your hips  however the sweater isn't slimming cause of the odd shape,Fine gauge

1,I was excited to see this sweater in my local store. i have been coveting it online. it was just as pretty in person as i hoped it would be.   the color is vivid and beautiful. i loved the buttons down the back.   i usually wear a size small but they only had an extra small. i tried it on and liked the way it fit. i wanted a snugger look. i think the small would have worked too  just a looser feel.  the fabric is very soft. now just waiting for cooler weather so i can wear it.,Fine gauge

1,"I ordered this in the ""chocolate"" color which is really a pinkish/taupe-brown. but i love the color; it's neutral yet not too pale  just the right hue to go with almost any color and the style works with any outfit  from jean shorts to a dress. i love how soft the knit is. although i worry it might be prone to snag  especially the open-weave sections. i also love that the sleeves are full length  fitted enough to be pushed up on my forearms yet i can pull them down past my wrists when i am chill",Fine gauge
1,This pullover is a beautiful deep blue color with a unique  relaxed design. when i first bought it  i found a snag on it and had to exchange it. the new pullover didn't have any snags  but did have a hole along the seam. i really like the pullover's relaxed fit and unique design  but the fabric doesn't seem very durable and is prone to snagging. time will tell how well the fabric holds up.,Fine gauge

-1,3 tags sewn in  2 small (about 1'' long) and 1 huge (about 2'' x 3''). very itchy so i cut them out. then the thread left behind was plasticy and even more itchy! how can you make an intimates item with such itchy tags? not comfortable at all! also - i love bralettes and wear them all the time including to work. i am a b cup. however  this one is so thin and flimsy that it gives no support even to a b cup - so for me this would only be a lounging bralette - if it wasn't so itchy!,Intimates
-1,The first time i wore this tank it started pilling around the arms and down the sides. it is terribly quality  and gets worse with every wear and wash. possibly the worst wear on a new clothing item i've ever seen. like the design and fit  immediately relegated it to a weekend/home shirt because it was unprofessionally pilly and the pills are small so can't be shaved off.,Intimates

0,I'm a b-cup who hates traditional underwire bras  so i was excited to try this one out. while i appreciate that this bra has more structure and support than other wireless comfy bras  the cups provided too much coverage for my style. if you want to wear a shirt with a wide neck  or do a cute off-the-shoulder thing with your shirt  the top of the cup shows. bummer!,Intimates

0,If your hips are bigger than a size 6 us you can't fully close this robe. the model must be wearing the larger of the two sizes to have such a nice oversized fit. the fabric is soft and lux and amazing  but the weird dart in the back and the closure is right over my sadly size 8 hips and butt. if i was taller and thinner i would have kept this and worn it every day.,Intimates
0,I wanted to love these because they are so pretty and come in lots of colors  but after only a few minutes of wearing them  i was having to pull them out of my bottom! why does women's underwear so frequently ride up? i normally wear a size 4/28  and ordered these in a m  but i guess they were still too small  which seems unreasonable to me. they are soft and pretty  but i will not be ordering more.,Intimates

1,Well-made  gorgeous bra! the 'red' is more wine in person  which is great. this bra runs quite small--go up at least 1 band and 1 cup size. i got a 36c and it fits great! (i'm a 34b across brands like vs  etc.)   you'll feel extra saucy and a bit mischievous knowing you're wearing something this sexy.,Intimates
1,A finely laced sheer bustier along with a gown split along the sides makes for a lovely sleeping garment. the material is cooling and the lace is not itchy.,Intimates
1,I absolutely adore this set. it's beautifully constructed-- perfect for something special but comfortable enough for everyday wear. i normally wear a 32 c but got the 34 a/b and it fits perfectly. my only complaint is that the longline portion tends to ride up and rest just below the underwire  as there is no band holding the lace in place along the bottom. still  it is far and away my favourite bra and i highly recommend it.,Intimates
1,This tank is perfect. it fits close to the body  but does not squeeze. it is super soft  smooth  and comfy. it layers perfectly under blouses. this is by far my favorite basic tank!,Intimates

1,This bra is obviously very pretty and feminine  but i was surprised that it's also really comfortable! it provides a pretty good amount of support  especially for an unlined bra  and feels pretty sturdy despite there not being much there. my 34b fit true to size.,Intimates

-1,I was leery of purchasing this blazer online without any reviews to read...and now i know better. the color and fabric are nice and what you would expect from the photos. the sleeves  however  ran small compared to the body. the shoulders also pulled and felt narrow compared to the torso. the body the opposite...too large and not flattering on an hourglass figure...no darts  no fitted places  nothing making it tailored to fit. open it hung wide with an unflattering silhouette. buttoned  it sprea,Jackets
-1,This is a beautiful kimono but just isn't made well. the one i received already had a couple small holes and a pull in the thread that was very noticeable. after reading the additional reviewer who wore it an hour and it was already pilling  it is going back for good. such a shame!,Jackets
-1,This blazer looks great on the model and i have a long torso so i thought it would be perfect. when i got it it looked like a big box and didn't fit anywhere. the shoulder pads were giant and the bottom of the coat was huge. i got a small based on other reviews  but it was way too big. sadly  i had to return it.,Jackets
-1,"I know this product description says oversized but that's an understatement. i ordered a small and tried it on and i looked like a little kid in their father's jacket. i don't even think an xs would have worked. i'm 5'6"" and about 135 pounds for reference. i will say that the embroidery on the back is very cool and this jacket is overall a cool concept but it's just way too big.",Jackets

-1,I built a new wardrobe around the three lovely velvet blazers: moss  copper and burgundy. they are soft  well-fitting  pretty linings and very satisfactory. this new version is stiff material  and ill-fitting. not coming in petite is a problem and it may fit others better  but it is too full across the front. with the stiff materials  this is a bad fit. disappointing and going back.,Jackets
-1,Read the reviews and thought i would just remove the label asap to prevent snags since i loved the item!   however  the item came with unrepairable holes  not just snags and they are either on the neck or front sleeve which forces me to return the item asap. didn't even try it on. so sad  but i still love retailer!!!,Jackets
-1,This vest looked so cute online but it's a disaster. the quilting is so bulky that the drawstring doesn't work properly and it just hangs. itlooks like something out of a costume closet that could be used for a peasant farmhand or a zombie movie. seriously  it's bad.,Jackets
0,Beautiful sweater coat! love that is easy to pop on & head out. i did have to go to a seamstress and have the button moved as it was to large and boxy around my waist area.,Jackets
0,I was excited to see this offered by retailer because i have been looking for a light blue summer jacket or blazer that isn't a denim jacket and this seemed to fit the bill. i've ordered several cartonnier blazers in 00p  as early as 2013 and as late as spring 2015  and have been very happy with them. on the plus side i would say that the color is depicted accurately and it does seem like a high quality jacket. but while the shoulders and sleeves were a pretty standard fit for 00p  it was much too,Jackets
0,This was a fail for me. although i ordered size large it barely fit my midsection when tied and was too small in the waist. the fabric is nice though. best on thinner frames than mine.,Jackets
0,I've been looking at this jacket on line and finally went to the store to try it on. i really liked the styling but the denim was quite stiff. i'd prefer a softer kind of fabric. i wonder if it would soften if it was washed. also  it ran surprisingly small. i usually take an xsmall or small but the small didn't leave me enough room to comfortably bend my arms. the medium worked better. i wonder how others feel about the fabric and and the sizing. i think i'll wait and see if this one goes on sal,Jackets
0,This jacket was too wide and the length in the arms too short. i wear a medium in almost any article of clothing and felt like i was swimming in a short little jacket. the ratio of how wide it is to the length is not for me but might work well with other body types. the arms were definitely too short.,Jackets
0,I didn't fall in love with this jacket but it was comfortable and seems like it has potential to be flattering on many body types. for reference i tried on a medium and my measurements are 38-30-40.,Jackets
0,"This is a beautiful lined jacket  with a much more structured fit than a typical kimono. it hit me at the high hip  not low hip as shown on the model. given how structured it is  i don't think the ""one size"" will work for anyone larger than a small if you want a drapey kimono fit.",Jackets
0,I tried this on in the store yesterday and i wanted to buy it very much. the jacket would work well for many sleveless tops or dresses all summer  and would work in an office. but  on me  the unusual cut of the arms emphasized the worst part of my arms (saggy or fat area) in a comical manner. if they tried to design a garmet to make arms look bad  the couldnt have done it better. further  the extra material against the body added bulk at my narrowest point (i am hourglass). again  not flattering,Jackets
0,I'm normally a 10/12 and ordered the m/l. the body was a little big but ok. the arms are really wide. there are snaps to make them tighter but it doesn't do much. i do like the embroidery. it's an ok jacket but the fit could have been better.,Jackets
1,I saw a stylist wearing a similar piece from a few seasons ago and commented that i liked it on her. i was told they had a different version (a few actually) and i decided to try it on. it actually is pretty flattering  i had flared jeans on but also could see it with a dress. i left it open  as pictured  tied one button  and also played with the neck and tried a cowl... all very nice.    i debated getting my usual xs petite  but hey  they don't make it in petite  and the stylist thought the loo,Jackets
1,I love this vest  good denim quality,Jackets
1,I have never loved denim jackets because they always have seemed kind of basic or boring. this one is edgy and the design is amazing. it can be worn with anything and will go through many seasons. i found the fit to be on point. my normal medium fit perfectly.,Jackets
1,Perfect fall accessory and transitional piece for cooler days. classic red and black check with a fashion flair. great with jeans or dress it up with jewelry. a great find!,Jackets
1,"The fabric is so thin  i think this entire garment might actually fit in a normal-sized letter envelope. the problem is not going to be that the garment is see-through (which it is) - it's the fact that the super thin fabric is not silky  it's cotton-ey  and i suspect it will get ""stuck"" against the back of my shirt/pants while i'm wearing it and not drape nicely. i wonder if some tiny weights could be sewn to the bottom hem to keep it laying properly.....    however  i'm such a sucker for a pre",Jackets
1,"I am very happy about the jacket. i like the material and the cut. i was able to wear the jacket for a walk on a rather windy day  about 60 f  with a thin sweater underneath  and it felt comfortable.     the fit is very flattering. i would prefer the sleeves to be a little longer (5'7""  125 lb  got size s). also  i wish the lining was full  not just the front detail - it would allow more versatility. but that's just me...    overall  i like it :))",Jackets
1,I have always liked this look so ordered my usual size s. fit is good & looks pretty much on me as in the pic - even the arm length works - not too long. i don't care for the placement of the top buttons which are just cosmetic. they dangle downwards showing more of the loop than the button itself. placement is not directly over the bottom buttons  which puts it in the lower breast area. mmmmm... not the look i want. looks unattractive. if i keep this  i will have to move the buttons more in lin,Jackets
1,This blazer is really well made  it has a nice weight and stretch to it. i think it might run a bit on the large size  i am sometimes a small and sometimes an xs and the xs is perfect. it's a great blazer to throw on to cinch together a casual yet put together look. i don't think the picture here does it justice. it will be getting a ton of wear in my work wardrobe. i love it!,Jackets
1,I have not owned a denim jacket of this kind in...15 years? i have a wonderful pilcro chambray jacket with a military cut from last year  but this kind of boxy  straight up denim jacket cut has not been a part of my life for a while. however  i was in a store last weekend and with the additional 25% off  i thought it might be wise to give this a try. i'm so glad i did. i've now tried it over two fairly girly dresses  with tights and booties (it's not exactly spring in boston yet)  and i love it.,Jackets
-1,I've purchased pilcro jeans in the past and they've held up great. unfortunately  the material used for this particular jean is a far  far cry from what it used to be. the thighs of these jeans start pilling (yes pilling!) after just a few wears. i've never had jeans do this -- whatever denim blend they are using is a complete disaster.    don't buy these -- you will be very disappointed.,Jeans

-1,I've never had a problem with pilcro jeans. i own several pairs. however  i ordered my regular size 28 (i'm 5'3  120 pounds) and not only were these jeans thin  they had zero stretch and after 1 hour of wear stretched out horribly. they fit really loose and hung around my knees and legs which is very disappointing for a skinny jean.,Jeans

0,I absolutely love the fit of these jeans! they are perfect in length and fit nicely on the hips. they are fitted and look nice with boots  but they do not feel tight at all because of the legging material. legging material  while comfortable  typically feels thin  but these do not and they are quite warm.  the one major drawback is that the pants have pilled on the thighs. i have had these pants for about 1.5 months now and i have washed them (and have hang dried them) about 4 times. i have neve,Jeans

0,Nice soft jeans  cute style  and i wish i could keep them...they just are too small on me. :/ not sure if i've gained weight (which i don't think i have because i had on a size 28 pair of pants today) but i ordered a size 29 in these jeans and they zipped but just too snug around the waist. i would honestly need a 30 or 31. looks like they are selling out quickly so i doubt i'll be able to get the size i need.   if you have a small waist i think they would be fine but they don't fit my body type,Jeans

0,I went on a wild goose chase for these jeans  as they were sold out all around the country. i finally got the last pair from some store in the midwest! they are my favorite pair of jeans  they fit very well. however  for the price  they should not get loose and baggy after 1-2 wears. i hate that they need to be washed and dried so often so that they will fit properly. expensive jeans should not sag. i have abercrombie jeggings for a fraction of the price that never get loose  even after 20 wears,Jeans

0,I love the wide straps but it runs small and is short. still great for layering. great  soft material. i hate that it is so tight and short but if i size up them the arm holes would be way too big.,Layering
0,I loved this when i got it. it has such a flattering fit! slightly loose in the body  but not flowy. nice weight of fabric. comfortable fabric. perfect scoop neck that doesn't show too much cleavage. but i washed it once on delicate and line dried (which i do with most of my shirts) and it came out riddled in holes.,Layering
0,This seemed to run a little bit small on me... more form fitting than on the model in the photo. also  it's thin. i'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look. the lace applique is pretty  and if you purchase it for that  then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black.,Layering
0,"This spandex top  in my opinion  is workout wear. it is not the tank i expected to receive  but my bad. it is super stretchy tank like most folks use with leggings or workout shorts. it does seem small but perhaps due to the kind of tank it is  it should fit like this. 5' 5"" 142 lbs medium is skin tight. color is nice but  as i wanted a tank to wear with skirts or jeans and this is not what i had envisioned-it has to go back to retailer. quality seems fair.",Layering

0,I nearly always wear a size small  and sometimes even a small is too large. not in this case; this top is extremely snug. i would not be able to wear this  and i would've returned for a larger size but the ivory color was a little too yellow for me. in the online photo. the color is more of an off-white than ivory yellow. i'm guessing also that this fabric may not stand the test of time and easily snag. but that's just conjecture.,Layering

-1,I was so looking forward to wearing these pants on an upcoming trip. i already had my outfits planned! when these pants arrived  however  they were very different from those shown in the pictures online. firstly  the pants are  in actuality  quite cropped. i am 5'9-- the model in the pictures is at least that height  if not taller-- and the hems were several inches above my ankles. secondly  the pants appear to be an even wider cut than what's shown  although the width of the pant legs may have,Pants
-1,"The other reviews seemed promising and so i ordered these in a 10 petite. i am 5'4"" and the length was still long and would either need to be worn with a heel or altered. the length was not what made me send them back though. the quality is very very nice and the fabric thick  stretchy and well made. however  the body hugging fit and flare make these look exactly like a yoga pant but made from nice material. if i were a bit more confident to wear these outside of the gym then they would be great",Pants

1,Wearing these for the first time today. the way the pants are made is the way a pair of quality pants should be. the fabric is gorgeous; the fit is excellent. the tone on tone flower is subtle but visible and creates a lovely pattern. the denim treatment at the ankle and waistband is a nice added touch. true to size  too. these are not your run of the mill above the ankle pants - they're something special and worth the money...the fact that i did get them on sale makes it an even better purchase,Pants
1,Love these pants! i'm 5'10 and the length is perfect. could even wear a little heel. the fold over waist is so comfy  they feel like pajamas but look very classy. i bought the navy and silver (more of a khaki color) on sale for a great deal. the washing instructions say line dry but i threw them in the dryer on low and they came out fine. just need to remove and hang quickly for less wrinkles.,Pants

-1,The picture makes the shorts look structured. i assumed they were made of a heavier cotton material. i was disappointed when they turned out to be a light weight polyester.     also  this runs way too big. i am busty and did not fill out the top of the xs.    i wouldn't even buy this at the sale price.,Shorts
