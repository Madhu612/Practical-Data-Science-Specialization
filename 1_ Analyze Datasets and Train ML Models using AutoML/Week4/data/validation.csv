__label__-1 "this did n't work for me . im normally a m ( 8/10 ) . got this in xs . that was the correct size for me i believe . however the armholes were huge . husband said the top of the dress looked like the autobots symbol from transformers and he wanted me to keep it . but i sent it back ."
__label__0 "the dress fits true to size and is pretty comfortable . i did look kinda matronly with my 34d chest . it 's a good basic to have on your closet but i ended up returning the one i bought . it did n't feel special enough to keep ."
__label__-1 "it just is n't that flattering on me . it looks kind of old and dingy even though it 's brand new . it fits fine but does n't do much to highlight my curves . it just kind of hangs there . the length is somewhat awkward ( i bought the petite version ) . maybe it would look good on someone tall and skinny like the model . it 's gathered around the stomach area and longer in the front which reminded me of maternity wear . it does appear to be pretty well made ; top part is lined . overall it 's not terrible"
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but it was not right for me . made my curvy body look shapeless . also had a button crack before i even put it on . returned it ."
__label__-1 "i tried this top on thinking it would be cute for the summer . it looked more like a maternity top with the fullness in the bottom . so if you 're expecting this one would be great ."
__label__0 "the regular length i tried on in store definitely did n't work for me . for reference in the photos i have a medium on and my measurements are 38-30-40 ."
__label__0 "while i love the green color and the soft waffle knit of this top it was so wide i could have fit two of me standing side by side into it ! i mean it was truly laughable ! do n't know what the manufacturer was thinking but this one needs to go back to the drawing board ."
__label__1 "these trousers are not lined . there is a wide elastic band that runs along the inside of these slacks that is not tacked down which is a little cheap and probably to keep the price down but does n't affect the overall fit . and they do fit nice . when your putting them on the fabric bunches at the crotch but then slims out after you zip them ( zips up the back . ) the fabric has some spandex in it but the lyocell makes them a great choice for work . they hit my ankle a bit lower than on the model . i 'm"
__label__1 "these are the best trousers i have bought in a long time ! i 'm 5 ' 8 and 145 pounds and the 8 fit with a bit of extra room in the waist -- not enough to size down . i love that they are not skinny -- so over the skinny fit . i plan to wear these with black heels white tee and the vegan black leather jacket i purchased at the same time -- oh and a statement necklace -- always a statement necklace . these are a must for every fall wardrobe ! more pants like these please !"
__label__0 "this dress is tricky . the fabric is very thin and the under slip it comes with runs small . i wear it with my yoga shorts underneath . the fabric is a very thin linen . my husband loves me in this dress so that a huge pro . its very light and cool perfect for the summer time ."
__label__0 "i really liked this dress in so many ways . i 'm tall and pear-shaped so the flowy shape is great for me . however the deal-breaker was how the armholes were cut . it is n't that obvious in the photos but they are cut in around the bust in the front in a way that was really weird looking on me and it was too expensive to keep something that 's unflattering . too bad if they had just had a normal armhole it would have been a home run . lovely fabric and nice that it has pockets ."
__label__-1 "i wish i had read the other reviews before purchasing this product . label says that you can wash and dry normally . however upon washing the outer layer shrunk and the inner lining did not . the robe will now not lay flat ; the fabric pulls at the edges and results in the inner lining being revealed when the robe is tied shut . extremely disappointed . for a $ 100 garment i expected much more . i wish i could return this ."
__label__1 "this is my new favorite top ! looks and fits as described ."
__label__1 "fits true to size . good quality style and length ."
__label__1 "i love this top and it 's so pretty in person . knew it would be full but was hoping it would n't be too big . it 's perfect and looks good with jeans ."
__label__1 "this is an attractive fitted vest . the tight belt on the back gives it a new look great shape . the fabric is good quality . the neck is tight and high . i usually get a small at retailer but this small is way too tight and there is no way you could put a sweater under which you usually do in weather cool enough for a vest . judging from the photo i would guess she is an extra small wearing a small or medium . it looks good with taupe or brown pants/jeans"

__label__-1 "i was definitely wearing retailer colored glasses ( my term for when something looks great on you in the dressing room but leaves you wondering what-was-i-thinking when you try it on later ) when i bought this . once i tried this on at home i basically felt like i was swallowed up by this thing -- there 's so much fabric layered in front and around your shoulders that you can actually feel the weight hanging down around your neck and it naturally sticks out rather far in the back . i wanted to love t"
__label__-1 "i generally do n't write bad reviews but there is a real discrepancy between the quality of this kimono and the cost . the design and colors are great but the fabric is ripping on all the kimonos on the rack in my store where the manufacturer 's tag is at the back of the neck . the material is very thin so there are other small holes beginning throughout the garment . i shop at retailer all the time and this is not a $ 98 item of clothing ."
__label__1 "these jeans were not for me . they are very straight ... hence the name 'parallel ' . i 'm have more of a straight athletic build so for me it was too much straight and did n't flatter my shape at all . however very nice jean once again from pilcro ."
__label__0 "i fell in love with this dress the instant i saw it . but was disappointed when i received it . first was the color . i chose the green and it was n't what i thought . it was a very unnatural shade of artificial grass . when my husband saw it in the package he thought i had ordered a cheap grass hula skirt . the color was that bad . the fit was the next problem . this dress would have fit nicely if they had just added a side zip and made the top more fitted . the top was loose and that added to the flowy"
__label__-1 "so i recognized the fact that this dress was likely intended more for lounging than for wearing out and about but i once had a lot of luck with dresses of this price point ( and intent ) at retailer so i had hopes . i was just wanting it to be a great addition for vacations and beach days but it 's honestly so thin i could n't even see it working that well for that . it 's also cut smaller than i was anticipating judging by the way it fits the model ; my usual small was way more bodycon than i was anti"

__label__1 "this sweater/coat is great . it super comfortable . it 's perfect for my california winters ! it could be layered for colder areas . this piece definitely runs large- like really large . i went with an xs instead of my usual small or medium . it is meant to be boxy and still is but sizing down allowed for it to be more flattering . i 'd definitely say go in store and try it on you 'll love it !"
__label__-1 "i also returned this dress after waiting weeks to received it . i had high hopes for this dress as i really loved it online but what a disappointment when i got it . the fabric is made of cheap poly that 's shiny thin and clingy . it shows every lump and bump you have . the zipper at the back wo n't lay flat and keeps bunching up creating an ugly bump . the sewing and hemline is uneven . there was n't a lot of thought put in in the print placement where the seams was sewn together in the midline"
__label__-1 "i 'm 5 ' 7 130 lbs . i ordered a medium-regular . the dress fell three inches above my knees . this model is taller than i am and it falls to her knees .... does n't make sense . i think retailer sends petites in place of regular ."
__label__-1 "i love the color of this top but the style is not flattering . i normally wear a l or xl in retailer clothes and i ordered a l in this and it was massive ! i went into the store to try on a medium and it fit much better but is still very bulky around the middle where the ruffles are and it is very wide . bummer"
__label__1 "really like the quality color and overall design of these jeans . they ran a little long on me but i just cut off an inch from the bottom and they fit perfectly with some tall booties . i did n't need to get them altered because the design of them is that they are cut at the bottom and are a little frayed . so glad that was the case given the price tag on them . i am 5 ' 7 128 lbs and wear a size 28 which fit perfectly except for the length which was easily fixed . definitely recommend these jeans"
__label__-1 "i ordered this dress in a size 8 my normal size at retailer . it is a lovely dress and so feminine but it is incorrectly sized . i could n't begin to button it . i reordered it in size 12 if that tells you anything . buyer beware . unless you are itsy bitsy you need to size up . i will say that as pretty as the photos are the dress is even more lovely in person ."
__label__0 "this sweater runs true to size . i am 5 ' 7 ' and 125 lbs and ordered the small . it has a beautiful mix of colors that reminds me of a creamsicle . it is a well made heavy sweater that will definitely keep you warm . if you like the feel of wool buy it . if not pass on it ."

__label__-1 "i am 5 ' 2 107lb and an xs petite.the embroidery was the only nice thing about this dress but everything else was really unflattering -- the huge puffy sleeves especially . another reviewer said this was more like a shift and she was right . not worth the price on sale ."
__label__0 "i love the fabric and pattern of this dress so much that i decided to keep it ( got it on mega sale ) but i would have never paid full price or anything close . the armholes are enormous showing bra and all . i am not particularly large chested ( 34c ) and the buttons are stretched to gaping on me even with the huge armholes . i have a cute red sweater coat that i will wear over it all fall but i could not recommend it because of the poor cut design . pros : great pattern fabric pockets true to"

__label__-1 "this is exactly the same cut as the breton peasant blouse which i also ordered . it 's extremely tight thru the bust and the sleeves are very wide at the top which adds width to the look of this blouse . it added 20 pounds ! the print is beautiful . the ruffles are trimmed with a golden colored thread which is a beautiful detail . i ordered size large and am well endowed . steer clear if you have a bust ."
__label__0 "the dress is nice but i was not excited about the color . the only color is this blue . also everyone has their favorite fit . i think i like some other fit better . my biggest problems are color and that is made majorly from synthetic materials . otherwise it fits well and for the right body type it will be perfect fit . i like to own dresses made of more natural materials ."
__label__-1 "if i stopped eating for a couple of months or jumped into a time machine and set the dial for 1990 i would really enjoy this beautifully made delicate blouse . the problem area is evident looking at the photo -- the tiny tight fitted gorgeous bodice . i will keep this piece becasue i love it so and the apocolypse is apparently imminent and i have hardly any food in the house ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater . comfortable and flattering . great for going out causal and staying warm !"
__label__0 "this dress is so so cute . i ordered an xs and it was a bit longer in person than pictured but that 's an easy enough fix since i know a good tailor . the problem is that the dress is n't lined . it 's made of thin see-through cotton so it leaves nothing to the imagination . for the price of this dress i would have expected it to be suited for more than just a bathing suit cover-up . without a slip underneath it ( if you can find a strapless one ) it is unwearable in most social settings . it 's such a sha"

__label__-1 "this is an absolutely beautiful dress but arrived with several holes in it !"

__label__0 "i bought this shirt in 3 colors . soft comfortable fabric as other reviewers have mentioned and nice detailed sleeve . i am gravely disappointed in the fabric quality since after wearing this one time with a necklace ( as shown in the picture ) it developed tiny pulls . i should mention that it was a very plain necklace nothing sharp pointy etc . i will most likely return all 3 shirts ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks very beautiful on the model shown . unfortunately when i tried it on it did not flow as nicely as i would have liked it to . i also did n't care much for the waist ties on the side . an elastic waist might have been better ."
__label__0 "construction excellent . the dress was pretty big around the hip ... does not have a shape like seen in the picture . the fabric was beautiful but was stiff ... like furniture . the color was not as vibrant as the picture . returned ."
__label__0 "this is such a cute top with so much potential soft fabric vibrant colors and flattering fit on top . however like so many of retailer swing tops lately it has tons of fabric at the bottom making it billow in a very unflattering way . i ordered it in an xxsp so i ca n't even go down in size so this top regrettably has to go back . i love swing tops but retailer could we please have tops that do not double for maternity tops ? ?"
__label__1 "this top is really cute- the plum is a lovely color and the top fits true to size . love the back detailing . and it is really good t-shirt quality ."
__label__1 "a fun casual romper . i loved the pink color ( not usually my thing ) which looks great with darker skin . like another reviewer said the waist is quite small so i would recommend sizing up one or two sizes ( i took a size 6 in this but am usually a 2/4 ) - this will make the top part a bit blousy but i think that adds to the appeal/ look ."
__label__0 "i really wanted this top to work but i felt that it was big and boxy . it 's shorter in the front and longer in the back . the seam and peplum hit at a strange place and made me look disheveled . it 's definitely worth trying on but did n't fit me ."
__label__-1 "nice quality fabric and design but found the armhole cut weirdly and fit of upper bodice strange . wanted to love it but sadly sent it back"
__label__1 "this is a very nice jacket in a pretty textured fabric . it seems to fit tts and the cut is very flattering . however - the white is actually ivory . not a big deal unless you were trying to match an outfit with pure white in it . still on the fence about whether to keep it or not ."
__label__-1 "this sweater did not flatter a sz 12 with 36d chest . it 's very well made but not for the curvy girl . this is my very first review and felt compelled to share my thoughts since i heavily rely on others ' reviews before i purchase ."
__label__0 "the fringe and fit were beautiful but the lace with it ( a little hard to see in the photo ) seemed like an odd pairing -- just too much going on . returning . . . ."
__label__1 "i thought this sweater was pretty and soft and would be comfortable to wear . i really liked the high collar and the interesting poncho-like design . but the sleeves were a bit short on me . and i thought it was a little pricy . i decided against it for those reasons . but if you do n't mind those things then you might like it . it 's definitely worth the try ."
__label__1 "i got the purple color and absolutely love it . i am 5 ' 2 but decided against the petite size and i wanted it to be a bit longer . i also went with the xxs as the xs was a bit too loose on the arm . it was definitely a splurge to buy the sweater but it looked so lovely !"
__label__0 "i carefully read the reviews and decided to order a medium since that size works for me generally with floaty styles . the neck was a bit small but once over my head it fit and looked nice . the deal breaker for me is the huge droopy armholes that showed half my bra . the colors are deeper than shown . but the pattern and length overwhelmed my shape feeling a lot like a maternity top . i liked that the sides are shorter but overall it 's just not my style . better suited i think for taller slimmer bod"

__label__-1 "i tried this on in the store and it was huge . i could n't try on a smaller size because they only had a 2 and 4. i tried on my usual size 12. i do n't think the embroidery is as pretty in person either . definitely not worth the price ."
__label__-1 "hahaha .. this dress is hilarious ! it looks nothing like the image ! i am usually a 0/xs and 4 was the smallest size available so i ordered it . when i opened it it felt like 10 lbs of fabric . i thought maybe i ordered a size way too big until i could barely squeeze into the top of the dress . once i looked in the mirror i almost fell over laughing . the rest of the dress is huge . i do n't believe this dress would be flattering on anyone ."
__label__0 "nice weight and loved the design but the inside was what i loved the most . it does n't show in the photos but the zipper is a light blue and the fabric is double-sided so the inside is lined with light blue flowers on a darker blue background . cute detail ! the only drawback was the length of the sleeves . they were about 2 too long ... and i have long arms ! there was n't enough stretch in band of the sleeve to keep them up once you pushed them up . the only other option i came up with was to fold"
__label__1 "lucky enough to have the chance to try this on in the store ! the sleeves are not big"
__label__0 "unfortunately this dress ran very large on me ( please no more vanity sizing ! ) and minimized what few curves i have . my store did n't have this in petite so i tried a regular xs - the neckline was low and there were at least 4 inches of space at the waist . it also flares out quite a bit you can see this in the catalog shot . while this was n't flattering on me it may work better on curvier figures ."
__label__0 "when i received this dress today i was really excited to try it on . it is a pretty dress . looked good in the pictures . however when i examined it and proceeded to try it on i was really disappointed . the quality is ok but not expected for the price paid . and the cut is off . it is extremely small at the top . i am not big by any means ( 32d 109lbs 5 ' 0 ) . the bottom part fit . sadly not impressed . this one is going back : ("
__label__-1 "i also expected this sweater to have more bulk to it per the images . it is very thin as others have said . the design is awkward with the sleeve placement and that makes it more flowy vs. structured . it is more similar to a cape or shawl design . if you ; 're looking for a warm cozy blanket sweater design this is not it . i will keep it though as a layering piece and because of the sale price and classic color design ."
__label__1 "i ordered the medium my usual size for flowing tops . it fits nicely looks amazing from the front and looks slimming . then i turned to the side and oh my ... my boobs protruded like two big balloons . i looked like wonder woman . there was plenty of fabric and it was billowy so it was n't the size just the cut . i do have 34 g 's but what the heck ? the color is glorious but it has to go back ."

__label__0 "this may be lovely on some people but it did n't work on me at all . i thought it would have some swing to it but the bottom hem was tight . if i had gone up a size the top would have been huge . the bib was n't flattering on me and it 's also quite sheer . too bad because the print is great . maybe if you 're athletic with slim hips you can manage it . i think if you are busty this could look like maternity wear on you . back it went sadly ."
__label__-1 "the color of the sweater is beautiful but the fit was awful . it was too swingy and made me look like i gained 10lbs instantly ( i 'm 5 ' 1 108lbs ) . i will be unfortunately returning this item ."
__label__1 "i ordered one size down and it 's still plenty roomy . as others have said the sleeves are a tighter fit but there is a tiny bit of stretch to the fabric . i 'm smaller busted and did n't want the v-neck to get too low so i sized down one . very cute tucked into jeans or paired with leggings ."
__label__-1 "this dress is huge . also i was super disappointed in the fabric . i thought it would be silly like a georgette . but it was coarse more like a poplin and thin . i thought it looked cheap ."
__label__1 "beautiful dress but works best with a belt where the dress cinches at the high waist . it runs huge : i 'm 5 ' 6 and a m/l but the small petite is what looks and fits the best . there is a lot of unnecessary fabric and stretch at the waist . i received a lot of compliments on this dress ! glad i kept trying on smaller sizes ."

__label__0 "the design is cute but there is way too much fabric in the lower part of the shirt . also the fabric for the lower part crumples easily . unless you carry around an iron you may not want to wear it outside the house . i kept the shirt to wear around the house ."

__label__0 "definitely pj quality . i have a fairly thin frame and this hung on me like a tent . and it 's very thin so it works as a swim cover but definitely not a dress for anything else ."
__label__-1 "so i really loved this dress . i am tall ( 6ft ) and the size 8 was perfect length . i would have worn it with flat dressy sandals . i would say it is true to size . i am not a flowy dress kind of girl but this was just the perfect amount of flow without making me feel like i was wearing a long potato sack . the back is just gorgeous and unique . here is why i could n't make it mine . the tube top part is completely detachable and extremely thin . there is literally not much to it and i 'm not sure it wou"
__label__-1 "this skirt looks/lays exactly like the photo . i bought a size small and i usually wear a size 4. it was maybe a smidge big but nothing that affected the look of the skirt . the material reminded me of felt/wool mixed together almost like sunday school felt cut outs ( but stiffer ) ( not a fan ) .. i was underwhelmed - it looked plain and simple and the color washed me out . definitely not worth the price ( for me anyways ) . good luck !"
__label__-1 "loved the idea of this - unfortunately it disappointed all around . it 's way too short and ran small . the fuzzy collar was also different than pictured in the stock photo and looked a bit tacky and cheap . the pricepoint is also way off the mark for this piece . usually an retailer small ( 57 140 lbs 32dd ) but ordered a medium ( small would not have fit in this piece ) . do not recommend ."
__label__-1 "when i saw this online i immediately put it on my must buy list . i hate paying the exorbitant shipping fees retailer charges so i was waiting until i could get to my local store in the meantime it looks like it has sold out online but i am sure it will be back in stock soon . luckily my b & m store had it and i am so glad i did n't waste my money or time ordering it online . this could have been great but once again antho missed the mark . what the product shot online does n't show is that it has dol"
__label__0 "first i absolutely love this dress and i was super excited when it arrived today . i sized up as other reviewers recommended and the dress fits perfectly . however when i zipped the dress up the zipper came apart in the center . going up another size would make the dress fit improperly so i am hoping to exchange it for a new one and have better luck with the zipper ."
__label__1 "i love this dress for it 's unique design with the crochet features . it is super comfortable great for being layered without see through . i ordered a small though and it is still too large for me . i have been trying to decide on returning it since i love it so much . i 'd recommend sizing down for this dress . i 'm 5 ' 6 '' 135lbs and still needed an xs which seems a bit off . i guess i 'm used to retailer running a bit big but i miss judge this one and hate to deal with the mailing and worrying"
__label__0 "i loved this at first .... but the quality is awful ! it pilled like crazy and started to get little holes near the neck after 4-5 wears . second sweater from retailer this year with severe pilling issues . i love retailer but will never again buy another sweater here ."
__label__-1 "this skirt is very pretty but not only does it run small but only a small portion of the waistband is elasticized so there 's very little stretch . for those of us with a significant difference in our waist and hip measurements there 's no way to get this skirt on past the hips ."
__label__1 "really pretty for summer especially beach and pool wear . but i 'm only 5 ' 1 and even the petite is i think a tad long for flats ( which is my preferred shoe for this dress ) . i 'm also curvy and busty on top so unless you are blessed with a nice thin waist it 's not as flattering as the tall thin model shows . but still it looks nice on and i though it might look good also with white footless tights i have too . so i 'm on the fence about keeping it since it 's really pretty for a summer party ."
__label__0 "love the shape and cut of this top but it is so sheer you could see my belly button through it . if it was a dark color i would buy it . wore my regular size small . i 'm 5'5130lbs and 32dd ."

__label__1 "this jacket is a real treasure and i could never have seen how substantial the embroidery is from the photo . also from the pic the jacket looks like a thin cotton but on the contrary it is a wonderful weight with a feel like denim . the embroidery is a wonderful texture like heavy string or thin rope so it really has dimension ... . i loved it so much i got the sweatshirt also by the same designer . ca n't wait until cooler weather so i may live in it ! also when you have it on for a bit it seems to"

__label__0 "these are very cute leggings . i love the ribbed bottoms . as far as design and comfort they are a five . but after only two wearings they are pilling like crazy and look shabby . i 'm very happy i only paid $ 23 for them . if i paid full price i 'd be more upset ."
__label__0 "i 'm a tunic lover so i 'll usually take a chance on them . im 5 ' 4 '' and usu a size 8 or medium . i ordered a small instead of a usual medium since other reviewers said it runs small . this hits about mid thigh which is a good tunic length but the overall fit is oversized . it 's more like a swimsuit cover up rather than a nice blouse . that 's really the best way to sum it up . oversized swimsuit cover-up like top . i 'm going to exchange it for an xs but i think even that 's too large ."
__label__-1 "i ordered this tee despite the price . the fabric is very thin and the quality was poor . nice concept for a tee but failed in quality and value . it was returned ."
__label__1 "i love that his blazer is soft and not so structured . so great for a business casual environment . the gray goes with everything and is already a staple in my wardrobe ."
__label__1 "another cloth and stone success ! love the back ! denim goes with most anything !"
__label__0 "the fit is quite strange on me as the tie is very high on the waist . this makes the jacket look odd and quite voluminous . i was very impressed with the fabric though but will have to return . i wish retailer would post what size is the model wearing . maybe she is wearing a larger size than usual which falls lower ."
__label__1 "i ordered this online but i own the vest and i love it so i took a chance . this is a super comfy great quality jacket . the sleeves are some kind of knit material and that makes it really cozy and not constrictive . the color i ordered the green is perfect . i ultimately returned the jacket because i thought the lapels were just too wide for my liking . they look exactly like the picture so if you do n't mind that you will probably be very happy with this jacket . it just was n't for me . i ended"
__label__-1 "the shirt is very soft but it felt very large and unflattering . the back felt bulky and looked awkward . definitely returning ."
__label__0 "this is absolutely huge . it felt like it was at least 2 sizes too big - the empire waist was n't even semi- fit . 36d chest and size small was like a tent . however the embroidery was beautiful"
__label__0 "this dress is such a beautiful color and the fabric is super soft and lovely . it would be stunning on someone with a slim figure but since i 've got curves/an athletic build it simply did not work . too bad because it is such a pretty dress !"

__label__1 "i will preface this review by stating that this item was available only in one size at my local retailer . they have a section of dresses mostly offered online that are in store for you to touch see try on and order through the store ( which is much appreciated ) . i am normally a size 0-2/xs in retailer clothes and i will typically order a petite when available . the option my store had to try on was a regular medium which is what i have pictured here . i mostly wanted to try it on just to get a fee"
__label__0 "i want to like and keep . at this price point i cant justify keeping . if it does go to clearance i will reorder . due to the thin material it seems more summery and casual than what i was anticipating . true to size . i ordered a medium and am 5 ' 9 and 155 pounds ."
__label__-1 "wow this is huge ! i 'm all for the tent-look with the right style but this was absurd . i could have fit two of me into the width and with the peplum style extra width does n't flatter anyone . the fabric is also so thin that it does n't hang nicely it kind of floats around the body . if you want a wide top then this is perfect but if you wanted something that hangs nicely look elsewhere . i purchased a petite s my typical size ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress but the buttons are tiny and the top one cracked in half before i could even put the dress on . i ca n't risk the buttons breaking off while i am wearing it . especially since the dress seems designed for an a cup anything larger will be more than those little fragile buttons can handle ."
__label__-1 "fits large wrinkles easily and not what i expected for the price ."
__label__-1 "i had such high hopes for this dress but unfortunately it misses the mark completely . the design is flawed in that you can not raise your arms to shoulder length . for someone who is 5 ' 3 105lbs the dress has no shape and looks like something from zoolander 's derelict campaign . i think one must have a specific body type for this dress but regardless they 'll have to keep their arms at their sides ."
__label__1 "omg when i saw this coat in the baby blue i knew i had to have it . i tried it on and fell madly in love ! i decided it was the only thing i needed in this world . it is soft and cozy . comfort with an old fashion hollywood glam . its almost sold out already so grab it if you can cuz its divine ! does run a little big so i got a 0 instead of a 2 and its perfect ."
__label__1 "this is a gorgeous buttondown . the colors are stunning - i love the mix of blue and brown . the fabric is super soft and drapes just right . i feel the this shirt runs true to size . i 'm an xxs petite and it fit perfect . this one is a winner !"
__label__1 "pros : versatile summer weight t. perfect with jeans . flattering cut . nice color palette . made in the usa . reasons for not giving 5 's for overall rating and quality ... shirt is a bit short overall ( i 'm 5 ' 4 ) . fabric is thin and a mixed blend of poly cotton and rayon . will have to be careful with washing . better if you can purchase on sale . regular price was steep for a t-shirt ."
__label__-1 "even on my 5 ' 1 short-waisted 100 lb body this was super short . it was also super boxy . not flattering at all . the blue was a good color but this is going back ."
__label__0 "i am totally on the fence with this shirt . like the other reviewers i sized up because my normal 14 was too tight in the chest ( a common problem for me ) . the arms are strangely tight and i did n't get much more room in the bust with the 16. but then the bottom of the shirt tents away and hangs funny . this is obviously meant for those with a very small bust who are on the slender side . i love the pattern and material though so i 'm going to visit my trusty seamstress and see if she can place dart"

__label__0 "this seemed to run a little bit small on me ... more form fitting than on the model in the photo . also it 's thin . i 'd be sold on it for sure if it were just a little longer too because i like the almost-lingerie-like look . the lace applique is pretty and if you purchase it for that then it really shows up better on the two lighter colors - it really gets lost all in black ."
__label__-1 "this is so thin and poor quality . especially for the price . it felt like a thin pajama top . the buttons are terrible little shell buttons . this could not have been returned faster ."
__label__0 "when i received this tank i ordered the blue i almost returned it because it seemed really thin almost see through . however once i tried it on it had a good fit not see through just lightweight and breezy . i especially like the twisted details on the straps . i would suggest a bralette with a cross back for comfort especially because it is on the thin side ."
__label__1 "i do not know where to begin .... this sweater exceeds my expectation ! i ordered this along with the mes demoiselles fringed sweater and i thought that was the game stopper .... as beautiful as that one is ... this one made my mouth fall open . it is unlike anything i have . it is an oversized substantial chic piece that is all over the runways . not to mention the color that i can not stop staring at and it will go with everything ! order your regular size as it is suppose to be big !"
__label__-1 "this dress had so much potential but the horizontal knit ruined it . i tried on size xxs in grey since my usual petite xxs size was not available . the fabric was a good weight and dress was well constructed . however the wide horizontal knit made the dress bulge out at places especially in the lower body thus made me look wide and bulky . i wish they had used a cable knit pattern which will make the dress drape much more nicely and more flattering ."
__label__0 "i really really wanted to love this dress . the v-neck plunge is way too deep . i needed to pin it to keep it closed . the blue color was pretty and the front was flattering but the back was not . it was super clingy in the back and did n't hang in a flattering way . sadly i sent it back ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited to get this top in the mail . i loved the colors print cut everything . i put it on and was so disappointed the top looks so much better on the model . i do n't know if i should have gone down a size ( i go between an xs and s ) but it looked terrible on me ! my husband took one look at me in it and said that 's being returned . still disappointed"
__label__0 "for my body type this top looked ridiculous ! i am small-busted and thinnish on top . this seemingly very pretty top look like a big rectangle on me . very unflattering . hard to tell if it was true-to-size because it hung so wide . i think for a gal with more substantial upper body ( i.e . boobs ) this would work better ."
__label__-1 "i normally wear a medium with these types of fabrics but this one was oddly proportioned on me . the skirt was also not very flattering to my hourglass figure but it at least fit well . the top was baggy and gaped at the armpits as stated by others . i really wanted to like this dress but it made me look 20 pounds heavier even in the places it looked too big on me . i could have tried going with a small but the skirt would have then been too short ."

__label__1 "i love this sweater ! i was nervous after reading the reviews but ordered it anyway and i 'm so glad i did . i got it in grey- the tie back/v-back feature is my favorite part -- flirty and feminine unique but also subtle . i do n't think the material is scratchy . it may not be as soft as some of my other retailer shirts but i would n't call it scratchy . it was perfectly comfortable to me . i will say that it 's a little short though . i vary between a m and l depending on the shirt ( 5 ' 9 long torso 36c"
__label__0 "i was excited to see this top on sale as i had been watching it for a few weeks . unfortunately i was very disappointed when i received it . it is as a previous person said very much like a pajama top . it is very loose and boxy and in my opinion did not flatter my shape at all . sadly i will be returning it . i would not recommend this top to a person who is athletic or straight and slender as you suggest ."
__label__1 "loved this top from the moment i saw it . i was bummed that this top was n't available in petite sizes but since it was my birthday i thought i would treat myself . i purchased the xs . after receiving it and trying it on it was big under the arms and waist area i kind of expected that since i am always a 00p in most retailer clothes . i had the top altered at a local tailor and now it fits me perfect ."
__label__0 "the color and fabric of this item are so appealing and i think this is a great piece for the right person . the fabric is beautiful but also much thicker than i 'd imagined from the photos . it has a quilted quality so does n't drape very well and is just too much fabric for me around the arms . i typically wear a size 12 and ordered the large . i think a medium might have been better . have n't decided yet whether to exchange for m or just plain return . has an artsy cool professor vibe that i like ."

__label__-1 "i was so excited to find this shirt on sale at my local retailer store . but i did not notice the high percentage of rayon in the fabric which caused the shirt to shrink significantly in the wash ( even when following washing instructions ) . i washed it on cold with woolite and it is about half the length it was initially ! i 'm so disappointed . how can you make a shirt that ca n't withstand washing ? !"

__label__-1 "this tunic only barely resembles the photo in person . first the color is much less saturated and more orangey than it appears in the photos second it 's huge . i 'm 5 ' 4 and typically wear 2 or 4p in retailerpolgies ' shirts/dresses . i ordered the sp and the dress was at least 1.5 times wider than it needed to be . it hung off me completely boxy and shapeless ; and the style does n't really lend itself to use with a belt ."
__label__-1 "cute and very soft but the elastic was n't sewn in right . i took them out of the wash and the waistband was a twisted mess . disappointing for more expensive loungewear ."
__label__1 "i love this top . it was cool on a summers day . i did get one of the strings of the design snagged but it worked out just fine not ruined at all ."
__label__0 "ahhh i should have listened to previous reviews . indeed this top runs very large . style wise it is ok. i would say you could do much better at retailer ."
__label__-1 "the quality of the fabric is good but the fit is horrible . unflattering and strange . definitely a pass ."
__label__0 "fell in love with the look of this top in the store but they did n't have it in my size ( 0 ) -- thought i 'd try the 2 as the 0 was sold out online as well . alas the fit is rather tentlike -- it did not drape as i had hoped . a beautiful and unique pattern on the right body but on my slight frame it was not flattering . it 's going back to retailer ."
__label__1 "this is a gorgeous piece of clothing - true to size simple yet flattering lines very comfortable . it has such flattering little touches as well such as the detail work on the sleeves . love it love it love it ! i just wish it were machine washable ! !"
__label__1 "the fun coloring of this tee gives what would otherwise be a basic tee it 's flare . it is a very soft shirt and will be cute with anything . the length is good too - you can tuck in or leave out . i believe it is tts . it might be a little sheer in some lights but i think you could pull it off with a nude-colored bra . it 's not sheer enough to me to warrant an undershirt ."
__label__1 "i saw this top online and loved it . i was n't sure about sizing and because i do n't live near a store i decided to order two sizes . i 'm 5 ' 8 and typically wear an 8 or medium in tops . the 8 in this top though was much too tight in the shoulders . i sized up to a 10 and it fit beautifully !"
__label__1 "i usually wear a 4 in maeve and purchased this is a 6 in the orange . i 'm just over 5 ' 7 34c size 26/27 jeans . through the bust and arms the 6 fits great . i still found the front to be just a tad shorter than i am comfortable . it hangs well though if not a bit loose . definitely more billowy and boxy feeling in person . i think if it were slightly fitted through the waist the length would n't be an issue . and it is n't even that much of an issue but i did knock off a star for that reason . i bo"
__label__0 "really was excited to get what i thought would be a very versatile piece . unfortunately because i have ample hips the skirt just made me look very wide overall . in addition i am short at 5 ' 2 so the length was also not flattering plus it is high waisted - it was just a lot of denim on me that made me look too wide and even shorter ."
__label__1 "beautiful top ... the print is really unique and already received compliments on it when running my daughter in for school . it 's a little fuller on the bottom and flows out so i think i may pin it but it 's beautiful . definitely worth getting !"
__label__1 "i really wanted to like this dress on me but it was not to be . the color is one of my favorites but the dress accented all my problem areas . sadly i returned it . i 'm sure that someone with less substantial hips will look great in it ."
__label__1 "i ordered this in a large and its a super cute dress but this time the large ran super big ! i usually wear a 10 so sometimes mediums are too small . i 'm going to exchange it for a medium and see if that fits better . the beading detail is beautiful but just had too much fabric down below ."
__label__1 "this sweatshirt is the perfect solution to chilly mornings or evenings . sundry 's lightweight fleece is never too warm or cool . the fit is true to size . the short sleeves look even cuter rolled up once or twice . i know i will be getting a lot of use from this top once early summer comes along !"
__label__-1 "i keep trying to find a peplum that works for me but so far i have been unsuccessful . i just do not think that my shape and the peplum shape play well together ? aside from the peplum issue this shirt had a massive amount of material and runs large . the material alone is thick making it a bulkier shirt then add the volume of the peplum and i looked ( and felt ) huge . needless to say this one was returned sale or no sale ."
__label__1 "i ordered the petite size 27 and the fit is just like on the model ... not tight at all and very flattering . even the petite length is long on me and i will need to wear wedges or something with a heel but honestly that makes them even more flattering ... makes my legs look long ! i am 5 ' 4 and about 118 # . the material is so soft and substantial ... the color is very accurately portrayed online . i ca n't wait to wear this fall !"
__label__1 "this is a fun sparkly top that was great over the holidays with a sparkly long-sleeved top underneath and will be fun in the summer too . i got a size small since my regular size extra-small was sold out and it was still really cute . great cut and design . as others have mentioned the quality could be slightly better but it 's a good deal if you get it on sale ."
__label__-1 "i thought these pants were cute ! when i put them on they fit perfectly and were comfortable however i wore them for about 20 minutes and they were a completely different size and looked awful !"
__label__-1 "even in my usual petite small size this looked bulky and made me look stumpy . disappointing because the style looks so good in the picture and the material looks to be good quality . i do n't even know if going down a size would have helped . as others have mentioned it looks like a frumpy house robe ."
__label__1 "the first time i saw this in the store i passed it by because the fabric did n't appeal to me .... but the second time i tried it on and fell in love .... had to have it in the beautiful blue . i 'm busty 32h but wear a small and the gathers do wonders to camouflage which was a nice surprise because i usually avoid anything with fullness . will look great with white or black jeans but i will also pair with a very subtle pattern legging as the length is perfect . i 'm short 5 ' 3 . neckline is fem"
__label__0 "this is beautiful fabric and a good fit but it 's such a pain to get on and off that i just do n't want to hassle with it . the button is in the back and very tricky to reach . too bad because otherwise it 's darling !"
__label__0 "i got this 25 % off before christmas . i immediately started wearing it thinking it would be a staple . i like the swing shape ; the shape feels just right - not too baggy . but the material is more washed out looking than the picture reveals collects lint like crazy and out of the box the sweater looks like it has been laundered several times . also there is a particularly prominent hole in the chest area ( as you can see in retailer 's picture ) . it looks out of place in person . i 'm left loving the s"

__label__-1 "i so loved this dress online . not so much in person . first of all it did n't fit my build . i 'm 5 ' 4 with a 32f bust and the waist line was just a bit too high to be flattering . mainly i 'm returning it because of the fabric . the petticoat netting does rustle as another buyer pointed out . my main fault is that the top fabric is synthetic and cheaply printed . basically it 's the lining fabric of a better made dress or coat . if it were cotton voile or silk it would have been beautiful . why they made i"
__label__0 "i was so excited to get this top ! i love the bow at the neck and the frill sleeves so current . unfortunately it was difficult for me to pull it over my head ! the neck opening is too small and there are no buttons . i have a pretty small head and very fine straight hair so i can imagine that others will have a similar issue getting it on ! i am keeping it because i love the style but will need to alter the neck myself . the rest of the top fits just a bit loose . i got the x-small and am a 3"
__label__0 "i really wanted to love this top . love the mix of fabrics and patterns . but it is too short for a tunic length . i should have paid attention to other reviews . i 'm about 5 ' 8 '' and was not too tight in the bust and shoulders.i have to return because the length is n't right ."
__label__-1 "this dress looks lovely on the model but it looks just awful on me ! i am 5 ' 4 and curvy . the shoulders are cut w/ a weird shape . instead of a cap sleeve it is like a pointy cap on the side and stuck out on my shoulders . it looks like i am ready to get beamed into space . the material is nice and the sequins are pretty but the cut of the dress is unflattering ."
__label__-1 "i really wanted to love this dress but i could n't . it ran large and heavy . rather than a sleek cocktail dress it felt more like a heavy sack once i put it on . there was one upside : the drape in the back did not appear to drop quite as low so finding a bra to wear under the dress might be easier than if it draped as low as it appears in the picture ."
__label__1 "but when i saw this top in person urged by my stylist when they got it in i decided to try it on . they had xs in store my former normal size ( xs or xsp ) . that was too big though . not being sure how the petite would look and not sure if smaller would work i decided to order all three : xxs xsp and xxsp ! verdict on size : xxsp was pulling at the arm holes kind of small there . xxs regular was almost right but arm holes were a little high not as comfortable . xsp ended up being the right c"

__label__-1 "i grabbed this dress to try on in my usual size because i needed to see what the hype was about this style of dress and it left me puzzled . the print was pretty but no amount of tailoring could save it for me . it was wearing me . maybe it could wear three of me . i feel like this is a way for clothing manufacturers to cut corners by making a garment without details ( no installing more time consuming zippers buttons or snaps and making something that fits a wide range of sizes because it"

__label__-1 "this top was a big disappointment . i ordered two of the grey motif with the print of the forest animals in size 16. neither of them fit well but one was cut much smaller than the other . i 've had this problem with all of the numerically-sized buttondown style of maeve tops . i do n't understand why in size 14 & 16 this keeps happening . that 's why i purchase two of each . usually one fits and the other does n't . this time unfortunately neither worked . they both were too tight in the arms/shoulders"
__label__1 "i am kicking myself for listening to an earlier negative review and not ordering this dress months ago . i finally took a chance on clearance and i love it ! the knit fabric is soft and beautiful ! so is the design and construction . the fabric is very light and delicate . all the details on the dress are just top notch . the body of the dress is lined but the sleeves are not - so there 's a slight see-through effect on the sleeves showing the lovely and delicate knit . it fits like a dream and i 've"

__label__1 "the is such a cute a-line skirt and perfect for the summer with a white tee . i bought the moss color and the rose gold buttons on it look really pretty . i 'm 5 ' 1 103 pounds and bought the 00 regular since i did not want to go too short with the petite size . it does run slightly big so order a size down if you have a smaller waist . love this and the price !"
__label__1 "i thought this shirt was really interesting online and it does n't disappoint in person . i love the uniqueness of the shirt but wish the quality of the white fabric was a little higher . overall though this was a great find and i know i 'll wear it again and again ."
__label__0 "this is a cute dress not real form fitting and made of a thin but comfortable jersey material . little see thru and kind of sexy though if you have cute lingerie ."
__label__1 "this is one of the most comfortable swimsuits i own . i purchased it in the turquoise dots print and found that it was colorful and perfect for a beach getaway . the adjustable halter style makes it really comfortable yet cute . i highly recommend this suit to those looking for a unique yet whimsical swimsuit style ."
__label__1 "this dress is beautiful . it was on back order and i waited about three weeks to receive it . i usually wear a size 8 in retailer but because it was a button down dress i ordered a size 10. the bottom is a great fit but the top is difficult to button . it is a heavier weight so i feel it is better for the spring than the summer season ."
__label__0 "the fit is definitely more straight-leg and not skinny as the photos seem to imply . at 4'11 and 95 lbs the size 25 fit my waist and butt wonderfully and the length was great but the jean lost shape at the knee . i would recommend these jeans if you are not seeking a skinny fit !"
__label__1 "this dress is really lovely in person . the fit was perfect and the length not too short . for reference i 'm very busty at 38f and the dress actually fit ! ( i 'm an xl usually and the fit was tts ) the only thing i 'm not crazy about is the slip it 's more of a flesh toned color . i 'll probably swap it out for a white one please make more like these retailer !"

__label__0 "i love this dress but it is too short to keep . i am 5 ' 8 and weigh 124lbs . most of my cloths from retailer are either a size 4 or a small but this dress is substantially shorter than other dresses purchased from retailer . it looks adorable on but it is just too short ( about 3 inches above my knees ) to be considered professional enough to wear to work ."
__label__0 "this is one of those dresses that might be better for those under 40. on me the fullness of the pleats and the bell sleeve made me feel like i was wearing one of those dresses for a much older lady . i miss not having to consider those things . the red color is lovely and the dress is modest . i just think it will read a lot better on a younger chiquita ."
__label__-1 "looked really cute on the hanger so i took it with me into the dressing room . the fabric is super soft and the top is very flattering however the bottom is way too short ! you ca n't tell from the picture but the sides are rounded and go up higher on your leg . the model has the waist band pulled lower than i think you 'd most likely be wearing it making the outfit appear longer . i wish i could pull this off ... maybe i 'm just too old for it ."
__label__-1 "this looks so gorgeous on the model on the site so i ordered it online . it was incredibly frumpy when i tried it on . looks like i took a floor rug cut a hole in the middle and slipped it over my head . the sweater itself is so pretty its just too bad it falls so awkwardly on me . i normally wear a small so i ordered the xs/s and the sleeves still fall past my thumbs . its kind of itchy too . will be returning this asap ."

__label__0 "i 'm still on the fence about these . i realize they got great reviews but i thought they would be a bit thicker . they just feel too flimsy and too much like i 'm ready for bed . i was looking for more lounge pants that i felt like if i needed to run up to the store on a saturday afternoon that i was n't wearing pjs . i just ca n't get past that . they are totally cute but i was definitely looking for more summer lounge-wear . i ordered the small which fit fine . i wear 4-6 in retailer pants . i got the p"
__label__-1 "i was so excited about these pants but they were a total disappointment in person . the fabric is a rough gauzy texture . the bottom has a big hem that weighs down the pants and makes them hang funny like you are walking on stilts or something they do not hang or move well on the body . also they are very long but small in the waist and have a high crotch so the fit is pretty off . sadly these are going back ."
__label__0 "i saw this in that postcard catalog and it drew my attention immediately so when i saw it at the store i knew i would try it on . this dress is gorgeous - the lace is sturdy and wo n't easily be caught on things the chambray is substantial but light . it 's put together well and the slip covers greatly . the material is n't stretchy but it keeps it shape and i like that . i 'm 5 ' 7 and it hit me right at the knee so it 's a good length if you wanted to wear it with a cardigan to work as a spring"

__label__0 "the material deep color and design are gorgeous . however the dress is just too bulky for my 5 ' 2 and 110lb frame . i ordered a 0p and it just was n't flattering on me . it 's somewhat tent-shaped so the fact that it 's not at all fitted and has a thick lining made me look larger than i actually am . i 'm so disappointed because the dress really is beautiful otherwise ."
__label__-1 "this dress has a beautiful fabric i really hated to send it back . it was just so unflattering absolutely no shape to it . i bought a 0p i 'm 5 ' 5 and 117lbs and it looked like a maternity dress on me ."

__label__-1 "i really like the look of the top when it is photographed on other people but it just is n't for me . the fabric is stiffer than i would have expected and not very moveable . the fit is not quite right on me . the longer sleeves detract from the look of the shirt . i also generally prefer things a little more form fitting of which this is not . it was not very comfortable for me either so this was clearly not a win for me ."

__label__0 "i so wanted to love this suit ! it is so unique and cute however it does not wear well on a short girl ! i am 54 and the torso was much too short for me so the cut down the middle looked really wide and odd and the suit just made me look stumpy instead of sexy . also for how expensive this suit it i also thought the material was pretty thin for how expensive this suit is . i 'm sad to say it is going back ."
__label__-1 "the fit on this is so strange . the middle string is definitely too long and the thin halter top offers hardly any lift . the print is lovely and the quality nice for the price . the cups are padded which is nice i suppose but would barely cover anything bigger than a c cup i 'm guessing . i 'm a 32dd size 8 in pants and size 4/6 in dresses and i ordered a medium . i also have a long torso which probably did n't help ."

__label__0 "i did n't really notice the collar when i ordered it on line and i 'm not really liking it . it 's the rough unstitched thing they like to do sometimes and it just makes it look slightly more casual and well rough around the edges . it 's a nicely cut great fitting sweater though so i 'll be looking for some scarves !"

__label__-1 "i wish this dress was more fitted .. the dress looks more fitted and more vibrant in the picture . i bought this dress in an xs but i am not sure that going smaller would take care of the amount of material in this dress . it was shapeless and did not fall as nicely as it appears . i think someone with a fuller figure would look very nice in this dress . sad to say that it is going back ."

__label__-1 "such a beautiful and unique design - i only wish it fit ! it is so so boxy - i 'm thin but would have needed almost a foot of fabric removed in order to make it look right ( and i do n't mean making it super tight ) . the seaming and button details on the back are such that it would be tough to have a tailor refit it appropriately . so i had to return this despite really wanting to find a way to make it work ."
__label__1 "this dress is great but extremely short . i 'm 5 ' 6 wear a size 4/6 . the 6 looked like a tunic on me it was so short ."
__label__-1 "based on other customer reviews i ordered these trousers expecting a lightweight cropped pant that would be appropriate for spring and especially summer . however the fabric is much heavier than what i 'd usually wear in the summer . the cut of the trousers were superb though - i like a low-rise or hipster cut which these are . they are fitted and not oversized like many of the other retailer items i buy so if you are an xs these will be xs ( or runs small for retailer clothing ) if you like your clo"
__label__0 "i think you have to have stick legs/legs for days for this style to fit as pictured . i thought i had found the perfect boyfriend jean but once these babies arrived i was really disappointed . the color is slightly brighter than the picture which is fine though i was digging the slightly greyed look . anyway these were loose in the waist and crotch and fit snugly everywhere else . i have a fairly athletic build so it 's not uncommon for me to have issues with fit around the calves and thighs"
__label__-1 "i 'm baffled why none of the other reviewers have mentioned how large these pants are . i ordered the petite small and i 'm always a small . these are huge . i felt like i had on a large . i like the thin material and color and i 'm sad that they are so large ."
__label__1 "this jacket has great style is really comfortable and looks good with jeans or nice pants . i usually wear a small or extra small in all clothes but thought the arms were tight in the small . the medium is a better fit ."

__label__-1 "this top is a good concept but the structure of it is not for all body types . i am 5.6 and 135 and wear an xs to a s in retailer tops and i ordered this is a small and it was huge in the chest and tight at my hips ... will be returning ."
__label__1 "i love this sweater it 's so soft and it seems to mold to my body more every time i wear it . it runs true to size but i have noticed that as i wear it more and more it seems to stretch a little . overall i am very happy with it and would definitely recommend it !"
__label__1 "i absolutely love this sweater .... it is perfect for fall"
__label__-1 "i am a pretty curvy girl and thought the m/l was gigantic . i returned and was afraid to exchange for the smaller size thinking it would pbly be very large as well . it was not flattering because it was so boxy ."

__label__1 "i 'm happy to say i got this on the sale rack but had been eyeing this long before . it is a flattering fit on me in size large . i just love the colors in the print ! also the style is not a basic shell but a very feminine cut . the skinny straps are also a very nice touch . i plan on wearing this with my long white linen skirt denim capris or with shorts . i think i will also opt for a solid cardi or scarf . this is just so pretty !"
__label__0 "i think this dress is very pretty and i like that it 's made of silk . i also like the way it fits since it skims over my figure flaws without being too poufy . what i do n't like is the sloppiness of how the print was stitched on my dress . the print frame is offset and details are cut off in both the front and back ( you can see similar in the model shot from behind ) . for the price i was expecting a little more quality control . i also do not care for the lining . i do not think the off white is"

__label__1 "it 's too hot here in ca to wear this yet but i ca n't wait for cooler weather . i tried it on with skinny jeans and it 's darling . love how it 's much shorter in front with the side splits and long back to cover the bum . perfect for leggings . nice slim but not tight fit ."
__label__-1 "i rarely write a really negative review and retailer is my favorite store ever . but this dress is awful . i ordered the black and white . the fabric is very poor quality . the colors are washed out . i almost did n't try it on but i did and found that for me the fit was terrible ( though some of the reviewer pictures are cute ) ."
__label__1 "this cover up has great potential . i love the embroidery . the colors and design are great . however it has a number of loose strings . it makes me wonder what might happen when i wash it . the fabric is on the thinner side but it is not see through . the fabric would be nice for a hot day by the pool . i caught it on sale so i am keeping it ."

__label__1 "i love sweater knit dresses and this the first one i 've owned with a flare style that works . pattern placement is gorgeously done and is very slimming in a non-obvious way . i think the fabric is soft and warm . i wish the scoop neckline was a tad bit higher from a modesty standpoint . you may want to size down if you 're not busty . i am 5 ' 3 and m petite was the perfect length on me . shout out to the reno distribution center for getting this amazing dress to me in 1.5 days ? ! ? ! ? ! ! !"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress -- a throw-on-and-go outfit that was casual enough with sneakers for errands but stylish enough with dressy sandals for a brunch date -- but did n't for a couple of reasons . first it is way too short for me especially on the sides because of the war the ruffled bottom lay to wear as a dress . it was more tunic length- but i would n't want to wear pants underneath because it would take away from the overall aesthetic . also the ruffled sleeves give me unwanted volume th"

__label__-1 "very disappointed when i received this . the colors and ombre fabric are beautiful . beading and embroidery make it a even more unique top however the shape ruins all of that . first it is nearly a crop top . second it is boxy and it 's attempt to be a swing top only makes it bulky . third need to size down 2 sizes . had to return this ."

__label__-1 "woah these jeans looked ridiculous on me . i felt as though it was 1987 and i was raiding my mom 's closet . the combination of the light wash the crop leg and high waist with the odd stitching around the midsection make this a no . it really accentuates any pouch you may have . i was looking for a high waisted denim but these are very unflattering . i am 5 ' 3 / 140 curvy . no no no !"

__label__1 "i just received this coat and love it . the only downside is that online the color looks like a royal blue ( which i wanted ) but in truth the coat is a basic navy . this was not a deal breaker for me . i love the details . it is not lined as someone mentioned earlier but it 's not meant to be a heavy winter coat . i ca n't wait to wear it with jeans boots and a striped or plaid tunic ."
__label__1 "the quality of this vest is outstanding and the warmth is exceptional . i have worn it as a jacket on milder days in work as a warmth layer and brought on vacation to act as both plus a bathrobe . it is a very stylist piece that can be worn open or belted . it runs large by style but i am 5 ' 1 100 lbs and i can carry it off ."
__label__-1 "i thought this top was so cute but when i tried it on it is so big on the bottom it looks like a tent . i normally wear a l or xl and took it back to the store to try on a medium and that one fit better but the bottom was still too big . sad ."
__label__1 "this skirt makes me look at least a size smaller . i love it ! the sa was wearing it in the store and it liked great on her as well with just a plain white top . tts- got my usual 10 in green ."
__label__1 "i love this dress ! it is more of a thick cotton linen than actual denim . it fits true to size in the sense that i am usually a size 6 but i would say it is smaller on top than normal size 6 dresses . i am 5 ' 8 small busted and a pear shape so i like the more fitted style of the top with the a-line skirt . i love the length hitting just below the knee . it is flattering for my body type . seems well made and at a good price point ."
__label__0 "i love the colors of this top . it does run very large though . when i received my usual small i felt like i was swimming in the top not fitted at all . the material is a bit funky too - seems a little lower quality because of the fabric . will return and try a smaller size if there is one available at the store and see if i change my mind ."
__label__0 "i saw this dress in the store and absolutely fell in love with the fabric and just had to have it . i ordered it on line in my size and when it arrived i tried it on ( or tried to try it on ) and it did n't fit some parts of my bday ( mainly in the bust ) . i ordered the largest size so there was no where to go from there except to send it back . others here have complained about a strange fit in the tummy area ( i.e . too much material ) . i never got to find out because i really could n't get the dress"
__label__0 "i wanted to love this dress . i am not comfortable wearing dresses much above the knee and i liked the length and the way this looks on the model . however in person this dress is cut like a sack . it is not tapered at all in the waist and there is just too much fabric when you cinch the belt at least on me . it was oddly shapeless even with the belt . it seemed a size too large . i ordered the xxsp . for reference i am 5 ' 1 and 107 lbs . i ordered the neutral dress and i really like the fabric and c"
__label__-1 "this top is beautiful in design but sadly i will be returning . it is hand wash and even after doing so i had 2 unraveled threads resulting in large holes . unfortunate since it was so flattering before washing ."
__label__1 "i liked this coat but my family said it looked too much like something hilary clinton would wear . i am 54 and i think it made me look a bit dowdy since it runs a bit big ."
__label__1 "great fit and dark color ; thick yet very soft denim . only surprise for me was that the lacing is in the front ( i was expecting it to be on the sides ) but i love them anyway !"
__label__0 "strange fit if you have a short torso . i ordered a medium petite and the drop waist looked strange so i tried using a belt and it bunched up . returned the dress . why should a nice simple dress like this create such hard work ? !"
__label__1 "some reviewers found this skirt to be on the smaller side but for me it was big too bad the smaller size is sold out ( well all peittes are sold out ) . the length is also pretty long below the knee but in the narrow part still ... so able to keep it . the colors are great . i brought it in the store to try on in front fo the stylists adn they all loved it and told me to keep it ... winner for sure !"
__label__-1 "bought this shirt on sale . it was super cute in the dressing room and for the first time i wore it . washed it per the instructions ( wash delicate with cold water lay flat to dry ) and it shrunk so much i do n't think i 'm going to be able to wear it anymore . it was oversized and loose when i bought it so it shrunk a lot . there is also a small hole all of the sudden that i have no idea where it came from ( was n't there when i put it in the washer ) . very disappointed ."
__label__-1 "i loved this dress . it runs small ( i 'm normally a 2 ) so i had to get a 4. in the fitting room the zippers got stuck a lot . i assumed it was just from the way the waist was sewn in . finally i found a dress that would zip pretty well . i went to put on this dress for my rehearsal dinner the night before my wedding . my fiance and i tried in vain for 20 minutes to try to zip it up ... and then it broke . the part that was zipped became unzipped and the zipper had no where to go . it was awful . i co"
__label__-1 "i purchased this in the yellow xs . it is very comfortable but extremely see-through . you 'd have to wear a slip or something underneath it but i 'm not sure what would work based on the style and even if i wore a strapless bra it was still see-through . unfortunately i had to return it ."
__label__1 "this is the first maxi i purchased this summer . i went with a petite as the regular length would need to be altered and i did n't want to lose some of the pattern on the bottom . it is a beautiful flowy dress . no need for a slip . it has beads on the bodice . i kept the dress but it is tight at the chest area and sizing up would n't have made that much of a difference .. kinda uncomfortable in the chest area . has yet to be worn so may return .."
__label__1 "i love this shirt . the colors are just as depicted . the material is gorgeous and the top is very flattering . fits true to size for retailer small ( i 'm normally a medium outside of this store ) ."
__label__1 "i love seafolly boyleg bathing suits . i find them very flattering and just universally appealing . this one has beautiful summery design as well . i found it to be running slightly smaller than plain colored editions of this suit . i normally wear size 6 ( us size ) of this suit but this particular design 6 was too small and had to exchange for 8 ( us ) which fits perfect ."
__label__1 "i love how soft and substantial the fabric is . the fabric has a nice weight and drapes beautifully . the ruffle detail is very flattering . i have broad shoulders and this top looks great ."
__label__0 "runs very big . i ordered a l and need a m. unfortunately no medium left ! great top with lots of character . hate i missed this cute top"
__label__0 "i love the pattern of this shirt but there is definitely a design flaw in the arm/armpits ."
__label__1 "i have to agree with another reviewer that this runs slightly small . i 'm 5 ' 8 an athletic pear with narrow shoulders 34c and usually a 6 in tops at retailer . since the top looks a little short on the model i sized up to an 8 since i 'd rather have it be flowy and a little longer . i 'm very glad i did because it hits at my low hip and if it were any smaller it 'd be too tight in my chest . since it does n't stretch you need some space for your arms to move . if i could do it again i 'd actually si"
__label__1 "love this kimono . design is bohemian and it will be a great layering piece . can be belted over simple black dress or layered with jeans and boots . almost did n't purchase because of the reviews concerned with fragile material but i did n't find that to be an issue once i felt the garment . great piece for fall ."
__label__0 "i ordered this sweater in green and it was a lovely soft color . the style of the sweater was nice -- really deep side splits made it feel trendy . the sweater is a great length nice fabric and the side splits are appealing . however it was just so so big that i could n't pull it off -- i just swam in it . i am 5 ' 8 and 118 lbs fairly wiry ? .even the xs did n't work for me . perhaps it would look more suitable on a curvier woman . i even considered having it tailored since i 've had a hard time find"
__label__0 "this dress has way too much material . the material is really soft and beautiful but there 's too much of it . it feels like you 're wearing a big sack . sadly i 'll be returning it ."
__label__1 "i ordered down a size based on other reviews . i am 5 ' tall 110 lbs and a size 26 is a great fit . i ordered both the navy and turquoise colors . my only complaint is the turquoise color is not the vibrant blue in the photo but more of a green tone ."
__label__0 "the color and design/style are cute but i found this to be too oversized . if you want to layer it then it might be for you but i was hoping for more of a tailored look ."
__label__0 "the sweater is cute but scratchy ."
